PSMA Postcodes (Polygon) (August 2016)
Organisation:
PSMA
Abstract:
Postcodes are allocated to geographic areas to facilitate the efficient processing and delivery of mail to customers. The current four digit numeric postcode system was introduced in 1967 in association with the first mechanised mail processing centre in Australia. The government land administration agencies in each state and territory are responsible for gazetting locality names and boundary positions. Postcodes are only allocated to localities officially gazetted by land agencies. In the majority of circumstances, a postcode covers an area comprising of more than one locality. The decision as to whether a new postcode or an existing postcode is to be allocated to a locality is based on operational efficiency. Issues that underpin the decision are critically analysed; these include the configuration of the Australia Post network, transportation connections and delivery arrangements. All suburb/locality data used for the polygon geometry in postcodes is captured by the state and territory governments through appropriate agencies. The digital suburb/locality boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each Australian state and territory jurisdiction. The postcodes are provided by Australia Post and are required to facilitate the efficient processing and delivery of mail to customers.
